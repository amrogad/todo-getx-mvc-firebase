# Todo App
A todo list app created with GetX, Firebase and using the MVC app structure.

# Features:
- Create tasks with specific dates
- Side scrolling calender
- Add task to Firestore
- Change from English to Arabic
- Light pink and brown theme

I created this app in GetX to show that I also have experience working with GetX as a state management package and that I can use the MVC structure where I also kept everything organized didn't fill the UI with unnecessary code.
This app also has it's own components that can be easily customized and adapt to anything I want in the future, the app also uses validation on the textfield to make sure that the user input is always correct and to make the fields required.
